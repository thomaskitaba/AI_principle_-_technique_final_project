This repository contains the solution for the Artificial Intelligence course project, which is based on solving the Traveling Ethiopia search problem using various search strategies. The project covers a series of questions related to state space graphs, search algorithms, and intelligent systems development.

Project Questions and Solutions:
State Space Graph Representation and Search Strategies
1.1 Convert a generic state space graph for the traveling Ethiopia search problem into a manageable data structure (e.g., stack or queue).
1.2 Implement a class that uses the converted state space graph, initial state, goal state, and a search strategy (breadth-first search or depth-first search) to return the corresponding solution/path.

Uniform Cost Search Algorithm
2.1 Convert a state space graph with backward cost into a manageable data structure.
2.2 Implement a program using uniform cost search to generate a path from Addis Ababa to Lalibela.
2.3 Customize the uniform cost search algorithm to generate a path from Addis Ababa to multiple goal states, ensuring local optimums are preserved.

A Search Algorithm*
Given a state space graph with heuristic and backward cost, implement a class that uses A* search to generate a path from the initial state "Addis Ababa" to the goal state "Moyale".

MiniMax Search Algorithm
Assume an adversary joins the Traveling Ethiopia search problem, aiming to reach a state with good quality coffee. Write a class that demonstrates how the MiniMax search algorithm directs the agent to the best achievable destination.

Interactive Intelligent Systems
5.1 Design a functional three-wheel robot using Gazebo, with working physics and sensors like proximity sensors, gyroscope, and RGB camera.
5.2 Create a .world file with all the states in the relaxed state space graph using a Cartesian coordinate system.
5.3 Write a ROS-based class that uses any uninformed search strategy to generate a path for the robot from any initial state to the goal state in the given map.

Files Used:
The project consists of the following Python files used to answer the questions:

1-question.py
2-question.py
3-question.py
4-question.py
Summary:
The questions in this project are interrelated and are based on the algorithms discussed throughout the course. Completing the first few questions correctly will help you tackle the later ones efficiently. It is recommended to spend time understanding the concepts behind the questions for a smoother development process.

Submission Instructions:
The final submission is done through a Google Form, where you will provide your GitHub repository link.
Make sure your repository is clean and easily reproducible.
There will be an in-person presentation session a week after your final exam.
